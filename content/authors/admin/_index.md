I am Chunyang Wang(王淳扬), currently a project researcher (postdoc) in the [National Institute of Informatics](http://www.nii.ac.jp/en/) (NII, 国立情報学研究所), hosted by [Prof. Yuichi Yoshida](https://research.nii.ac.jp/~yyoshida/).

Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. degree in the [Theory Group](http://tcs.nju.edu.cn/) in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.nju.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University](http://nju.edu.cn/), where I was fortunate to have [Prof. Yitong Yin](http://tcs.nju.edu.cn/yinyt/) be my advisor. 

My research interest lies in a broad aspect of computer science. Currently, I am focusing on algorithms for counting and sampling, as well as algorithmic stability. Here is my [CV](uploads/CV.pdf).
