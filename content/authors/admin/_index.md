I’m a second-year Ph.D student in the [theory group of Nanjing University](http://tcs.nju.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to have [Prof. Yitong Yin](http://tcs.nju.edu.cn/yinyt/) be my advisor. 

My research interest lies in a broad aspect of computer science. Currently, I am focusing on algorithms for counting and sampling.
