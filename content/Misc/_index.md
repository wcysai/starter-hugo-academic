## Competitive Programming
I had a lot of fun doing competitive programming during my bachelor and doctoral study (my [Codeforces account](https://codeforces.com/profile/Roundgod). 

I also did some problemsetting in the competitive programming community. Here are some problems I proudly authored: [1](https://codeforces.com/gym/104065/problem/H), [2](https://codeforces.com/gym/104065/problem/K), [3](https://codeforces.com/gym/105632/problem/H), [4](https://ac.nowcoder.com/acm/contest/57358/I), [5](https://ac.nowcoder.com/acm/contest/81598/K).
