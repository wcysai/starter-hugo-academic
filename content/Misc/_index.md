What to do when you fail to solve a [problem](uploads/WFB.pdf) at the ICPC World Finals? Just leave it as a [homework](https://tcs.nju.edu.cn/wiki/index.php?title=%E7%BB%84%E5%90%88%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6_(Spring_2024)/Problem_Set_4)...

I also did some problemsetting in the competitive programming community. Here are some problems I proudly authored: [1](https://codeforces.com/gym/104065/problem/H), [2](https://codeforces.com/gym/104065/problem/K), [3](https://codeforces.com/gym/105632/problem/H), [4](https://ac.nowcoder.com/acm/contest/57358/I), [5](https://ac.nowcoder.com/acm/contest/81598/K).
