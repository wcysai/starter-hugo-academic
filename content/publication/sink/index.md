abstract: For sink-free orientations in graphs of minimum degree at least $3$,
  we show that there is 
  a deterministic approximate counting algorithm that runs in time $O((n^{33}/\eps^{32})\log(n/\eps))$,
  a near-linear time sampling algorithm,
  and a randomised approximate counting algorithm that runs in time $O((n/\eps)^2\log(n/\eps))$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the input graph and $0<\eps<1$ is the desired accuracy.
  All three algorithms are based on a local implementation of the sink popping method (Cohn, Pemantle, and Propp, 2002) under the partial rejection sampling framework (Guo, Jerrum, and Liu, 2019).
