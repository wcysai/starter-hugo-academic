abstract: We give a fast algorithm for sampling uniform solutions of *general* constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) in a local lemma regime.
#
The expected running time of our algorithm is near-linear in $n$ and a fixed polynomial in $\Delta$, 
where $n$ is the number of variables and $\Delta$ is the max degree of constraints.
#
Previously, up to similar conditions,
sampling algorithms with running time polynomial in both $n$ and $\Delta$, 
only existed for the almost atomic case, 
where each constraint is violated by a small number of forbidden local configurations.
